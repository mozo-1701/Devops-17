function Test-LabStatus {
<#
    .SYNOPSIS
        Queries computers' LCM state to determine whether an existing DSC configuration has applied successfully.
    .EXAMPLE
        Test-LabStatus -ComputerName CONTROLLER, XENAPP

        Tests the CONTROLLER and XENAPP computers' LCM state, using the current user credentials, returning $true if
        both have finished.
    .EXAMPLE
        Test-LabStatus -ComputerName CONTROLLER, EXCHANGE -Credential (Get-Credential)

        Prompts for credentials to connect to the CONTROLLER and EXCHANGE computers to query the LCM state, returning
        $true if both have finished.
    .EXAMPLE
        Test-LabStatus -ConfigurationData .\TestLabGuide.psd1 -Credential (Get-Credential)

        Prompts for credentials to connect to all the computers defined in the DSC configuration document (.psd1) and
        query the LCM state, returning $true if all have finished.
    .EXAMPLE
        Test-LabStatus -ConfigurationData .\TestLabGuide.psd1 -PreferNodeProperty IPAddress -Credential (Get-Credential)

        Prompts for credentials to connect to the computers by their IPAddress node property as defined in the DSC
        configuration document (.psd1) and query the LCM state.

        ## Specifies the application name in the connection. The default value of the ApplicationName parameter is WSMAN.
        ## The complete identifier for the remote endpoint is in the following format:
        ##
        ## <transport>://<server>:<port>/<ApplicationName>
        ##
        ## For example: `http://server01:8080/WSMAN`
        ##
        ## Internet Information Services (IIS), which hosts the session, forwards requests with this endpoint to the
        ## specified application. This default setting of WSMAN is appropriate for most uses. This parameter is designed
        ## to be used if many computers establish remote connections to one computer that is running Windows PowerShell.
        ## In this case, IIS hosts Web Services for Management (WS-Management) for efficiency.
        [Parameter(ValueFromPipelineByPropertyName)]
        [System.String] $ApplicationName,

        ## Specifies the authentication mechanism to be used at the server. The acceptable values for this parameter are:
        ##
        ## - Basic. Basic is a scheme in which the user name and password are sent in clear text to the server or proxy.
        ## - Default. Use the authentication method implemented by the WS-Management protocol. This is the default.  -
        ## Digest. Digest is a challenge-response scheme that uses a server-specified data string for the challenge.  -
        ## Kerberos. The client computer and the server mutually authenticate by using Kerberos certificates.  -
        ## Negotiate. Negotiate is a challenge-response scheme that negotiates with the server or proxy to determine the
        ## scheme to use for authentication. For example, this parameter value allows for negotiation to determine
        ## whether the Kerberos protocol or NTLM is used.  - CredSSP. Use Credential Security Support Provider (CredSSP)
        ## authentication, which lets the user delegate credentials. This option is designed for commands that run on one
        ## remote computer but collect data from or run additional commands on other remote computers.
        ##
        ## Caution: CredSSP delegates the user credentials from the local computer to a remote computer. This practice
        ## increases the security risk of the remote operation. If the remote computer is compromised, when credentials
        ## are passed to it, the credentials can be used to control the network session.
        ##
        ## Important: If you do not specify the Authentication parameter,, the Test-WSMan request is sent to the remote
        ## computer anonymously, without using authentication. If the request is made anonymously, it returns no
        ## information that is specific to the operating-system version. Instead, this cmdlet displays null values for
        ## the operating system version and service pack level (OS: 0.0.0 SP: 0.0).

        ## Specifies the digital public key certificate (X509) of a user account that has permission to perform this
        ## action. Enter the certificate thumbprint of the certificate.
        ##
        ## Certificates are used in client certificate-based authentication. They can be mapped only to local user
        ## accounts; they do not work with domain accounts.
        ##
        ## To get a certificate thumbprint, use the Get-Item or Get-ChildItem command in the Windows PowerShell Cert:
        ## drive.

        ## Specifies the port to use when the client connects to the WinRM service. When the transport is HTTP, the
        ## default port is 80. When the transport is HTTPS, the default port is 443.
        ##
        ## When you use HTTPS as the transport, the value of the ComputerName parameter must match the server's
        ## certificate common name (CN).
        [Parameter(ValueFromPipelineByPropertyName)]
        [System.Int32] $Port,

        ## Specifies that the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) protocol is used to establish a connection to the remote
        ## computer. By default, SSL is not used.
        ##
        ## WS-Management encrypts all the Windows PowerShell content that is transmitted over the network. The UseSSL
        ## parameter lets you specify the additional protection of HTTPS instead of HTTP. If SSL is not available on the
        ## port that is used for the connection, and you specify this parameter, the command fails.
